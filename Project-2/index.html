            <p class="p1">Hamilton Construction Co. (Hamilton) has been building bridges and highways as a heavy civil contractor since 1939. We have partnered with owners to deliver numerous award-winning, complex projects. Hamilton's performance in constructing bridges, highways, dams, and other critical infrastructure raises the bar for the industry's standard of excellence in honesty, quality, and collaborative approach.</p>
            <p class="p1 show-mobile">We are hands-on builders and self-perform much of the work we are awarded. Our bonding capacity, equipment inventory, material resources, and value engineering give us the ability to efficiently and effectively approach the most demanding jobs.
            Hamilton has five divisions and operates throughout the West. </p>
            <p class="p1 show-mobile">Our divisional organization allows us to better serve our clients and employees from local offices in Oregon, Washington, Colorado, and Alaska.</p>
