      <p>
        Our Hamilton family shares three simple, but strong, core values.
        We are prideful of who we are and what we do. We have earned a reputation for delivering quality projects, innovative construction methods, accelerated schedules, and reducing costs. Our years of experience, talented team, and valued partners make it easy to maintain our excellent reputation.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are hands-on heavy builders. While the national trend among general contractors has had a greater emphasis on contract management and less self-performed work, Hamilton has taken the opposite approach and focuses on being a hands-on builder. Hamilton is second to none when it comes to problem-solving and innovation in bridge, highway, and rail construction techniques.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are committed to growth: for our employees and the communities we serve.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hamilton has been building bridges and connecting communities since 1939 and has partnered with owners using accelerated bridge construction techniques and award-winning alternative delivery methods since 1970.
