      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
        Our Hamilton family shares three simple, but strong, core values.
        We are prideful of who we are and what we do. We have earned a reputation for delivering quality projects, innovative construction methods, accelerated schedules, and reducing costs. Our years of experience, talented team, and valued partners make it easy to maintain our excellent reputation.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are hands-on heavy builders. While the national trend among general contractors has had a greater emphasis on contract management and less self-performed work, Hamilton has taken the opposite approach and focuses on being a hands-on builder. Hamilton is second to none when it comes to problem-solving and innovation in bridge, highway, and rail construction techniques.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are committed to growth: for our employees and the communities we serve.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hamilton has been building bridges and connecting communities since 1939 and has partnered with owners using accelerated bridge construction techniques and award-winning alternative delivery methods since 1970.

      <h2>More About Hamilton</h2>
      <p>Hamilton’s design-build experience dates back to the early 1980s when, following the eruption of Mt. St. Helens in Washington, Hamilton was contracted to design and build replacements for dozens of bridges that had been damaged or destroyed. 
      </p>
      <p>Since then, Hamilton has delivered numerous complex bridge and highway projects under alternative delivery methods including design-build, progressive design-build, and CM/GC (Construction Manager/General Contractor).</p>
      <p>
        Hamilton became Oregon Department of Transportation’s (ODOT) first design-build contractor in 1998; ODOT’s first CM/GC contractor with the multi-award-winning I-5 Willamette River Bridge project in 2009; Alaska Department of Transportation & Public Facilities’ first CM/GC contractor with the award-winning Parks Highway MP 237 Riley Creek Bridge Replacement project in 2013; and the Bend Parks and Recreation’s first heavy civil CM/GC contractor with the award-winning Colorado Dam Safety Passage (Bend Whitewater Park) project in 2013.
